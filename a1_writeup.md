# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

Compared to Java, I think that it is a little bit easier syntax wise. Print statements are a lot quicker which I like a lot and the code is much more straight foward. It is like psuedo code when you are writing code and it is a lot easier to understand as opposed to Java.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Some differences between Python and Java is that when creating variables, data types are not needed. For loops are also a bit different. Print statements are very different. Some things that remain the same are return statements, however Python does not seem to be an object oriented language like Java is. 

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I learned a lot more syntax and how to do things in python. I also learned that python and java are actually quite similar in the problem solving perspective. Overall I think that python is a cool language and although it will take some getting used to it will be fun.
